# Prefixation Sketch Plugin

Manage the prefixes of your layers, artboards or symbols.

- No more re-typing prefixes for every layer
- Keep naming very consistent
- Organize all your Symbols into folders, consistently and quickly - yes you can do batch renaming of prefixes!


## How it works

**Path Prefix Manager** - Gathers all the layer names in your document that contain a "/" and generates a prefix list. You may then apply those prefixes to other layers, or create new one by typing it.

**Remove Path Prefixes** - Strips all the path prefixes in your selection, leaving just the layer names.
For example, "Folder 1 / Folder 2 / Layername" will become "Layername".
